## Summary

Trophish contains dietary data gleaned from the literature for 100's of freshwater fish species. The purpose of Trophish is to allow assessment of freshwater fish stomach contents [@ridgway2022trophish].

We extracted information from dietary reports ranging from the 1890's to present. The data set is located in `data/trophish_dataset.csv`.

Global coverage is represented by the map below:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Figure 1. Map of locations where dietary information was exctracted.", out.width = '100%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots/map_fish.jpg"))
```

## Approach

This database was compiled through searches of the primary and secondary literature. Secondary literature included "gray" literature, defined as non peer-reviewed reports or theses. After an initial broad search, subsequent searches were targeted to fill any obvious taxonomic or geographic gaps. A full explanation is given in @ridgway2022trophish.
